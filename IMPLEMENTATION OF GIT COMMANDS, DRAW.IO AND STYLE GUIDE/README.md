# Implementation of Git commands, Draw.io and Style Guide

## Project Overview
Initial groundwork related to Git version control, visual flowchart creation using Draw.io,
and best practices for documentation using a style guide. These tools form the foundation for
structured technical documentation and development, especially useful
as I move toward implementing and documenting Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols like BB84 and E91.

## Implemented Topics
**Git Version Control**
  - Practiced all basic Git commands including branching and merging.
  - Stored demonstrations and command outputs.
**Draw.io**
  - Learned to design structured flowcharts using shapes, connectors, and text.
  - Applied formatting and diagram organization features.
**Documentation Style Guide**
  - Studied how to structure technical documents using consistent tone, format, and terminology.
  - Understood its benefits in collaborative and large-scale documentation projects.
    
## Versions & Progress
  - Created foundational learning material and implementation logs
  - Documented Draw.io usage and style guide learnings
  - Organized files into topic-specific folders

- `Implementation of Git Commands/` – Contains hands-on Git command examples and logs.
- `Draw.io and Style guide-An overview.docx` – Explains the basics of Draw.io and style guide for documentation
- `README.md` - This file.

## Prerequisites
No complex setup required. Tools used:
- **Git** – Installed locally and configured  
- **Draw.io (diagrams.net)** – Used via web or desktop version  
- **Microsoft Word / any DOCX viewer** – For opening documentation files  
- **Text Editor** – VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad for reviewing Git files

## How the Content Works
### Git Commands
- Demonstrations for `init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `branch`, `merge`, `push`, `pull`, etc.
- Simulated version control scenarios with logs for understanding branching and conflict handling
### Draw.io Documentation
- Describes how to use basic shapes, text blocks, and connectors
- Covers alignment tools and formatting options for clarity
### Style Guide Summary
- Highlights tone, formatting rules, and structural consistency
- Explains what to follow and avoid in professional documentation
- Lists common applications of style guides in real-world projects
  
## Future Work:
## Upcoming Learning Goals:
- Review and study the documentation of **BB84** and **E91** QKD protocols  
- Apply the style guide to structure this new documentation  
- Begin implementation of BB84 and E91 algorithms with version-controlled code and diagrams
